# The Monkees  
The idea of this project was to create a front end only website for  
the band, The Monkees, the brief of the project said it had to be  
fully responsive and deveolped with a mobile first approach.  

## UX  
From a users viewpoint i wanted to make the website easy to navigate  
and provide details related to the band that the user would be  
interested in. The user can visit the website to hear about the latest  
music releases and view videos and pictures related to the band.  
They can also fill in the booking form to book the band for weddings,  
birthdays and corperate events etc. Fro the design of the website  
I looked at random bands websites and I noticed they are nearly  
always layed out in the same manner, I used this as inspiration for  
the layout on my website.

## Features  
Users are able to lisern to the latest releases from the band, look  
at pictures and video's on the media page, #they can book the band by  
filling in the booking form. The latest news about the band is on the  
home page of the website.  

### Future Features  
Feature that could be added are things like being able to buy the music  
off the website and having an events page where all the upcoming events  
are listed

## Technologies Used  
* HTML - this was used to dictate the layout of the page and show all  
visual elements of the website 

* CSS/SCSS - This was used to style the website and to keep all the  
css files organised, SCSS also allowed me to reuse classes  and set defaults with mixins  
so i wouldnt haveto keep writing the same code.  

* Javascript/Jquery -  this was used for visual elements such as the carousel and it is also used  
by bootstrap  

* Bootstrap- this is a library that helps you layout the website with a grid system  
and gives you the ability to add complex features easily, for example the toggle  
navbar. bootstrap also helps you to build you website to be responsive. 

## Testing  
To test this website I used both a HTML and CSS code validation service, This ensured  
that all my code was valid and had no issues. To test if the website was responsive  
I used multiple devices to see if the website rendered properly such as on mobile  
or tablet aswell as my laptop. I also used the chrome developer tools to check the  
responsiveness of my website as i was developing it.  

## Deployment  
To host this web page I used github pages, this was the best option because  
its just a one click deployment from your github repo settings page.
